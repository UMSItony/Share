    "For the original chart, it is much easier to made judgements about the magnitude by comparing the lengths of the bars than it is to attempt to compare perceived angles or area of the pie slices. This major difference between the two visualizations is accounted for by Stevens' law and leads to a major difference in the implied task  of being able to recognize a pattern (in this case, ranking by magnitude) by comparing perceived measures of magnitude. The obvious benefit of the pie chart is that it is clear that the emojis contained therein comprise parts of a whole. This can be somewhat misleading, however, since a sample of emojis is represented instead of the whole population of emojis employed in this online session. Further, it is clear in the original visualization which emoji belongs with which percentage data because it is located in the same vertical space. The pie chart encodes this with varying color, and the ability to tell the difference between some of the colors is difficult during the more complicated task of differntiating the data based on which emoji the data belongs to."

    "The representation of the numbers in the boxing gloves (green=56 and red=5) are not proportional to the quantities represented, and in fact, took quite a bit of cognitive effort to even ascertain what they were meant to represent. The years along the perimeter of the circle differ in length not based on years, but based instead on the number of matches within that year, which is another example of problems with representation of numbers without proper proportionality. In the particular case of the years and the issues with proportionality, this does not substantially affect the graphical integrity as much as the other proportionality concern. While a legend is provided for the acronyms used in the bar chart, the bar chart could have been enlargened and these data labeled directly in lieu of \"eye-catching graphics\" in the data visualization space. This legend could have been useful, instead, to explain acronyms positioned in the green and red wedges to represent actual incidents of KO, TKO, etc. This would have enriched the expressiveness of the visualization by labeling events in the data directly, and placing the data within its proper context. Perhaps this action of labeling the events in the data directly in the wedges could have resulted in a better representation without having to introduce addition design variation with a bar chart within a time-series chart. All of these ideas are ways in which this visualization is inconsistent with the graphical integrity principles put forth by Tufte."

    "*IMPORTANT DATA ISSUE*: There are some differences in the data that 538 used and what we have. This will cause some issues to how things are normalized. Things should look very similar, but you may find, for example, that the scale of tweets when you normalize is different than the original figure. This is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "*IMPORTANT STYLING/ANNOTATION* NOTE: Part of this assignment is to get styling and annotation to be as close to 538 as possible. Altair and Vega-Lite aren't super helpful for annotation purposes. You will find that you need to do things like layering text and the arrows (hint: see [here](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair/issues/1721)). What I usually do in practice (when I need the visualization to look good and have annotation) is get things as close to how I want them to look, export the image as an SVG and then load it into [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/), or [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html). You can see \"reasonably close approximations\" in the examples we provide. Those have been generated using nothing but Altair."

Five seconds later, Mayweather leapt up on the corner ropes, victorious — [50-0](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mayweather-is-defined-by-the-zero-next-to-his-name/). Some observers declared it a [satisfying spectacle](https://www.si.com/boxing/2017/08/27/after-months-hype-mayweather-and-mcgregor-deliver-boxing-spectacle). Others, McGregor chief among them, [were frustrated with the finish](https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/conor-mcgregor-frustrated-with-refs-fight-stoppage-let-the-man-put-me-down/). The emoji users on Twitter appeared to think the fight was, for the most part, 🔥 — especially as it heated up toward the end. While the result may never have been in question, this was a welcome outcome for many who viewed Mayweather’s last megafight against Manny Pacquiao as an epic 😴😴😴😴."

Further, we can be more exact about labeling the specific times events occur, such as when the fight begins, and it becomes clearer for both categories the behavior of the data around those events."

    "The article mentions that \"the majority of people in the arena appeared to be McGregor fans,\" but a slight majority of tweets during the match are from \"The Money Team.\" Consistent with the first visualization about the populatity of individual emojis and the immediately prior \"alternative\" visualization, the design here shows similar variability within the data and there is no need to introduce further variability into the design of the visualization. The only design change here was changing the axis lables to make them more detailed so that the difference between Mayweather and McGregor becomes more clear. These are two specific Tufte principles that lead to this being an effective visualization with good graphical integrity. This visualization also balances the quote from the article, and gives some context to the online conversation, which is the main subject of most of the visualizations in the article."
